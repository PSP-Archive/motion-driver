Motion kit driver for Neoflash PSP Motion kit
Version 1.0.0b

Copyright 2007-2008 Alexander Berl <raphael@fx-world.org>



1. How to install
Copy the contents of the SEPLUGINS folder to your memorystick. Don't overwrite existing .txt
files, but instead edit them to add the line
ms0:/SEPLUGINS/motion_driver.prx

Hard reboot the PSP and enter the recovery menu (Hold R trigger while booting) and enable the plugin.


2. Configuration
The motion kit driver can be configured with various settings through the motion_driver.ini file
inside the /SEPLUGINS folder.

There are 12 settings for letting the motion kit simulate button input and allowing the VSH or
games not written for the motion kit to be controlled.

The input can be generated by pushing/pulling the PSP in directions (*ACCEL settings) or by
tilting the PSP (*ROT settings).

Each setting can hold one or more buttons that should get pressed for each of the directions.
Multiple buttons are to be seperated by '|' (vertical bar), ie
POSZACCEL = CROSS|TRIANGLE
would mean that cross and triangle are pressed when you pull the PSP towards yourself.

The possible buttons are:
SELECT, START, RTRIGGER, LTRIGGER,
TRIANGLE, CROSS, CIRCLE, SQUARE,
LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN,
ANALOGLEFT, ANALOGRIGHT, ANALOGUP and ANALOGDOWN

Other options:
ENABLED		- enables/disables the motion kit driver
DEBUGINFO	- prints additional information on the screen
FILTERWIDTH	- How many values back to filter (0-15)
FILTERWEIGHT- How much weight to give each filtered value accumulatively (>0.1)
FILTERPOW	- By how much to power each motion input value to smooth out jumps around zero
SAMPLING	- How many samples to take per second (<=60 - default 20)


You can configure the driver per homebrew/game by creating a section in the ini file with the
path to the homebrew or the UMD Game ID. VSH and POPS are also possible.

6. Thanks&Greets

Thanks to all who made the PSPSDK possible.
Special thanks to TyRaNiD for PSPLINK. The function hook functionality is based on remotejoy's hook function.
Also thanks to crazyc for finding the function to enable sound output while the motion kit is plugged in.

Greets to the people from ps2dev.org and psp-programming.com
